        <button class="accordion">{{ block.settings.text }}</button>
        <div class="panel">
          {{ block.settings.answer }}

## Customization

- Adjust the styles in the CSS section to match your theme's design.

This template assumes that you may want to create separate Liquid and JavaScript files (`faq-section.liquid` and `faq-section-script.liquid`, for example) for better organization. Adjust the instructions based on your file structure and preferences.
